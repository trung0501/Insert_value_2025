The program inputs an integer n (15 <=n <=25 and n is even). Creates an array t containing n positive integers divisible by 2 (forming a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 6, ...). Inserts the number 2025 into array t at three positions: beginning, middle, end. Outputs array t before and after inserting the value 2025.
