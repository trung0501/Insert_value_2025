The program inputs an integer n (15 <=n <=25 and n is even). Creates an array t containing n positive integers divisible by 2 (forming a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 6, ...). Inserts the number 2025 into array t at three positions: beginning, middle, end. Outputs array t before and after inserting the value 2025.

 Enter integer n (15 <= n <= 25 and n is even): 16
 
   Initial array:
 
   [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32]

   The array after inserting 2025 into the head, middle, last:
 
   [2025, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 2025, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 2025]
